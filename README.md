# UFOs

**Purpose**

The goal of this analysis is to create a webpage where the data regarding the UFOs sightings are availabe for the readers to read the article and view the data simulateously with custom filter built in to cater their viewing needss.

**Result**

The reader can visit the webpage and look at the data by entering in the criterias in the filter search. For example if a reader wants to view how many times there were UFOs sightings on 1/10/2010, they can enter that criterea in the "Enter Date" search button and if they want to look at how many times UFOs were sighted in benton AR, they can simply enter that criterea "Enter a City" and it will show the result.

**Summary**

I would like it to further developed with the drop down menu in the filter search, also I would like for viewers to be able to click on the link of the data table and get more information on the sightings of the UFOs and at last but not the least I would like the webpage to include the UFO sighting from all over the world by providing contact us tab in the webpage where people from all over the world can submit the images and other details of UFOs sightings.
